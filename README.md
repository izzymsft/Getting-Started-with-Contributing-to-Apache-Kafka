## Getting-Started-with-Contributing-to-Apache-Kafka

We are the currently in the process of submitting a 40-minute talk on how to get involved with the Apache Kafka project.

Personally, as a beginning contributor to the project, it was a bit overwhelming earlier on in the process knowing where to start, what to do and how to get involved. The community and the project as a whole can really benefit from this type of content.

At a high level, we plan to cover the following:

- How to get started
- Who can contribute?
- Why we should get involved ...
- What and how we can contribute (tutorials, stack overflow, support email distribution lists, architecture discussions, docs, testing release candidates, submitting patches, adding/changing core and ecosystem components etc). Project rules and guidelines for contributing.
When to get involved.

Even if you are not able to participate as a presenter, you can still share my ideas/thoughts and get feedback.

Please reach out if you are interested in partnering on this. We plan to submit the CFP on Friday (May 15). 

Thanks.
