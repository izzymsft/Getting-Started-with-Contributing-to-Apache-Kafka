Contributing to an open source project can be a very rewarding experience especially when you realize how your contributions are transforming the project and impacting others in a positive way. However, as a newcomer sometimes getting started and getting involved in the project can be overwhelming. daunting and prove to be challenging when you are not familiar with the process, are confused about what to contribute and don't know how, when and where to start.

In this session, we will cover the benefits of contributing to an open source project such as Apache Kafka, why you should get involved, how you can contribute and the various areas you can contribute to the project such as developing tutorials, answering questions on stack overflow and mailing lists, proposing improvements to the project, participating in architecture discussions, updating the project docs, participating testing release candidates, reporting bugs, submitting patches to name just a few.
